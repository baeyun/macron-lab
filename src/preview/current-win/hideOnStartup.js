`<h2>Hide a window on startup</h2>

<p>Use <code>hideOnStartup()</code> to hide the current window on startup.</p>

<p>Note: Might not work as expected since the click event can only be fired once the window has started already.</p>

<button id="hideOnStartup-window">Hide a window on startup</button>
